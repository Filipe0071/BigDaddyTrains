# [Release] BigDaddyTrains

# Features

Trains resource for FiveM, enables naturally spawning of freight and metro trains and a metro ticketing system. 
Adds blips to the map for each metro stop. Allows players to "buy" a ticket to ride. Trains spawn near players about every two minutes.

This DOES work with OneSync on FiveM multiplayer servers.

Not all the ticket machines work. The red and black ones above ground generally work. Once you "buy" a ticket, it is good for one ride on the metro. As soon as you get off the train, you have to buy a new ticket to ride again. The purchase will have to be tied into your server's money system. There are comments in the code to show you where that would go.

#Credits

The spawning of trains as well as the "next stop" text came directly from https://github.com/TheIndra55/fivem-trams

The ticketing system was partially inspired by and based on:

	Blumlaut (FiveM Community) / Bluethefurry (Github)
